# Predicting Mental Health Emergency Rates
Code written by me on top of a colleagues code who I was working with at the end of my Degree at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre in Perth, Australia.

I wrote a triple-nested loop that was then run on the hospital's distributed computing cluster which tested and validated 527 different linear mixed models to see which one was able to predict mental health emergencies in Western Australia best.
