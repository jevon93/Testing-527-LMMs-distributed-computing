# Predicting Mental Health Emergency Rates
Code written while I was working with at the end of my degree at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre in Perth, Australia.

Tested predictive accuracy of 527 linear mixed models at predicting medical emergency hotspots via k-fold cross validation.

The code I wrote is from line 330 onwards.
